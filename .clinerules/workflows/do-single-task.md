When working in *Act* mode:

1. Initialize the project memory by reading: **memory-bank/projectArchitecture.md**, **memory-bank/currentContext.md**, and **memory-bank/progress.md**.
2. Find the **first unchecked item** in **progress.md** (a line that starts with `- [ ]`).
3. Create a plan (including tests as needed) to complete that item, then implement it.
4. When the work is finished, mark the item `- [x]` in progress.md. Stage and commit the changes. Inform the user you have completed the task.
5. If you hit the same error twice in a row *or* there are no open items, stop and ask the user what to do next.
