Torch-Based Gradient Descent Implementation Demo

This script demonstrates manual gradient descent implementation using PyTorch's
automatic differentiation capabilities. It includes:

1. A simple quadratic function optimization example
2. Manual gradient descent algorithm implementation
3. Visualization of the optimization process
4. Comparison with PyTorch's built-in optimizers

The purpose is to provide a clear understanding of how gradient descent works
under the hood, while leveraging PyTorch's tensor operations and automatic
differentiation for accurate gradient computation.
